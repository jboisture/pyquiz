        Overview
        --------
        
        The zope configuration system provides an extensible system for
        supporting various kinds of configurations.
        
        It is based on the idea of configuration directives. Users of the
        configuration system provide configuration directives in some
        language that express configuration choices. The intent is that the
        language be pluggable.  An XML language is provided by default.

        Zope configuration system
        ==========================
        
        The zope configuration system provides an extensible system for
        supporting variouse kinds of configurations.
        
        It is based on the idea of configuration directives. Users of the
        configuration system provide configuration directives in some
        language that express configuration choices. The intent is that the
        language be pluggable.  An XML language is provided by default.
        
        Configuration is performed in three stages. In the first stage,
        directives are processed to compute configuration actions.
        Configuration actions consist of:
        
        - A discriminator
        
        - A callable
        
        - Positional arguments
        
        - Keyword arguments
        
        The actions are essentially delayed function calls.  Two or more
        actions conflict if they have the same discriminator.  The
        configuration system has rules for resolving conflicts. If conflicts
        cannot be resolved, an error will result.  Conflict resolution
        typically discards all but one of the conflicting actions, so that
        the remaining action of the originally-conflicting actions no longer
        conflicts.  Non-conflicting actions are executed in the order that
        they were created by passing the positional and non-positional
        arguments to the action callable.
        
        The system is extensible. There is a meta-configuration language for
        defining configuration directives. A directive is defined by
        providing meta data about the directive and handler code to process
        the directive.  There are four kinds of directives:
        
        - Simple directives compute configuration actions.  Their handlers
          are typically functions that take a context and zero or more
          keyword arguments and return a sequence of configuration actions.
        
          To learn how to create simple directives, see `tests/test_simple.py`.
        
        
        - Grouping directives collect information to be used by nested
          directives. They are called with a context object which they adapt
          to some interface that extends IConfigurationContext.
        
          To learn how to create grouping directives, look at the
          documentation in zopeconfigure.py, which provides the implementation
          of the zope `configure` directive.
        
          Other directives can be nested in grouping directives.
        
          To learn how to implement nested directives, look at the
          documentation in `tests/test_nested.py`.
        
        - Complex directives are directives that have subdirectives.  
          Subdirectives have handlers that are simply methods of complex
          directives. Complex diretives are handled by factories, typically
          classes, that create objects that have methods for handling
          subdirectives. These objects also have __call__ methods that are
          called when processing of subdirectives is finished.
        
          Complex directives only exist to support old directive
          handlers. They will probably be deprecated in the future.
        
        - Subdirectives are nested in complex directives. They are like
          simple directives except that they hane handlers that are complex
          directive methods.
        
          Subdirectives, like complex directives only exist to support old
          directive handlers. They will probably be deprecated in the future.
        
        
        =======
        Changes
        =======
        
        3.7.3 (2011-03-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Correctly locate packages with a __path__ attribute but no
          __file__ attribute (such as namespace packages installed with setup.py
          install --single-version-externally-managed).
        
        - Allow "info" and "includepath" to be passed optionally to context.action.
        
        3.7.2 (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Prefer the standard libraries doctest module over zope.testing.doctest.
        
        3.7.1 (2010-01-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Jython support: use ``__builtin__`` module import rather than assuming
          ``__builtins__`` is available.
        
        - Jython support: deal with the fact that the Jython SAX parser
          returns attribute sets that have an empty string indicating no
          namespace instead of ``None``.
        
        - Allow ``setup.py test`` to run at least a subset of the tests that
          would be run when using the zope testrunner: ``setup.py test`` runs
          53 tests, while ``bin/test`` runs 156.
        
        3.7.0 (2009-12-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust testing output to newer zope.schema.
        
        - Prefer zope.testing.doctest over doctestunit.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed dependency of `zope.deprecation` package.
        
        - Don't suppress deprecation warnings any more in 'zope.configuration'
          package level. This makes it more likely other packages will generate
          deprecation warnings now, which will allow us to remove more
          outdated ones.
        
        - Don't fail when zope.testing is not installed.
        
        - Added missing ``processFile`` method to ``IConfigurationContext``.
          It is already implemented in the mix-in class,
          ``zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationContext``, and used by
          implementations of ``include`` and ``exclude`` directives.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-02-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added the ``exclude`` directive to standard directives. It was
          previously available via ``zc.configuration`` package and now it's
          merged into ``zope.configuration``.
        
        - Changed package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org,
          change "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in the package's url.
        
        3.4.1 (2008-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Use built-in 'set' type, rather than importin the 'sets' module,
          which is deprecated in Python 2.6.
        
        - Added support to bootstrap on Jython.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release as a standalone package.
        
        Before 3.4.0
        ------------
        
        This package was part of the Zope 3 distribution and did not have its own
        CHANGES.txt. For earlier changes please refer to either our subversion log or
        the CHANGES.txt of earlier Zope 3 releases.
