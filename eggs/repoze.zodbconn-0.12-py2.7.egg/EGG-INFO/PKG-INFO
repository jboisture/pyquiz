Description: =================
         repoze.zodbconn
        =================
        
        A lbrary which allows `ZODB <http://zodb.org>`_ databases to be
        constructed from URI specifications.

        0.12 (2010-06-25)
        =================
        
        - PersistentApplicationFinder: More eagerly open the database at
          startup time in order to avoid race condition where many
          simultaneous requests directly after startup might cause the
          database to be created more than once.
        
        0.11 (2010-04-26)
        =================
        
        - Made the URI resolver compatible with changes to Python's ``urlparse``
          module in Python 2.6.5 (tests all pass now on Python 2.4.6, 2.5.5,
          and 2.6.5).  Thanks to Fergus Doyle for the patch.
        
        - In the connector middleware, abort the transaction before closing
          the connection, to avoid an exception that would lead to leaked
          connections.
        
        - The ZConfig file parser now allows a config file to define multiple
          databases.
        
        0.10 (2009-06-24)
        =================
        
        - Added a ``zconfig`` URI parser, providing basic support for any
          kind of storage that ZODB can load via ZConfig.
        
        - Added a ``db_from_uri`` function, which is simpler to use than
          ``dbfactory_from_uri``; ``db_from_uri`` also supports
          multi-databases.  Replaced references in the documentation.
        
        - Added ``connector``, a WSGI framework component that connects to ZODB
          and puts the connection in the WSGI environment. It unconditionally
          closes the ZODB connection on exit.
        
        - ``PersistentApplicationFinder`` now gets the ZODB connection
          from the WSGI environment whenever it is provided.
        
        - Moved ``db_from_uri`` and ``dbfactory_from_uri`` to a module
          named ``uri``, to avoid circular imports.
        
        - Added ``cachecleanup``, a WSGI framework component that keeps only
          objects of certain classes in the ZODB cache. This helps control
          memory consumption.
        
        - Added ``transferlog``, a WSGI framework component that logs
          how many ZODB objects were loaded and stored per request.
        
        0.9.1 (2009-06-12)
        ==================
        
        - The ``EnvironmentDeleterMiddleware`` (the "closer") middleware did
          not delete the environment key if the application raised an
          exception, potentially causing connection leakage for applications
          that depended upon it doing so.
        
        0.9 (2009-06-09)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Added a ``LoggingCleanup`` implementation which can be passed to
          ``PersistentApplicationFinder``:  it logs counts of loaded and saved
          objects for the connection between the time it is instantiated (i.e.,
          whe the database connection is opened) and the time the connection is
          closed.  See the "Customizing Connection Cleanup" section in the narrative
          docs for notes on using this feature.
        
        - Added ``cleanup`` argument to constructor of ``PersistentApplicationFinder``,
          to allow applications to register a custom cleanup object factory.
          See the "Customizing Connection Cleanup" section in the narrative docs
          for notes on using this feature.
        
        - 100% unit test coverage.
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - Fixed breakage with ``file:`` URIs having no query string.
        
        0.8 (2009-05-25)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Fix a bug in FileStorageURIResolver whereby fully-qualified paths to
        Windows files (e.g. ``file://C:\foo\bar\baz?a=1``) were parsed
        incorrectly, resulting in a bogus file location.
        
        0.7 (2009-04-23)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Added support for multi-databases in PersistentApplicationFinder.
        Just pass multiple URIs to the constructor, either as a list of
        strings or a single string with URIs separated by whitespace. Each
        database must have a distinct database_name. The first URI specifies
        the root database.
        
        0.6 (2008-01-06)
        ================
        
        Backwards Incompatibilities
        ----------------------------
        
        ``dbfactory_from_uri`` now returns only a single argument (the
        factory).
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Docs updated with argument values for ``file://`` and ``zeo://`` URI
        schemes; this file converted to real REST.
        
        0.5 (unknown)
        =============
        
        Pass ``layout`` to BlobStorage as a kwarg explicitly (for forward
        compatibility).
        
        Depend on ZODB3 3.8.1+.
        
        0.4 (unknown)
        =============
        
        Add ``connection_cache_size``, ``connection_pool_size``, and
        ``database_name`` arguments to both FileStorage and ClientStorage URI
        resolver schemes.  ``connection_cache_size`` represents the ZODB
        object cache size (the ``cache_size`` parameter to the DB
        constructor), ``connection_pool_size`` represents the ZODB connection
        pool size (the ``pool_size`` parameter to the DB constructor), and
        ``database_name`` represents the ZODB database name (the
        ``database_name`` parameter to the DB constructor).
        ``connection_cache_size`` defaults to 10000 (overriding the too-low DB
        constructor default of 400), ``connection_pool_size`` defaults to 7,
        and ``database_name`` defaults to ``unnamed``.
        
        0.3 (unknown)
        =============
        
        Add 'egg:repoze.zodbconn#closer' middleware.
        
        Add blobstorage and demostorage support to zeo and file resolvers.
        
        0.2 (unknown)
        =============
        
        Unknown changes
        
        0.1 (unknown)
        =============
        
        Initial release.
