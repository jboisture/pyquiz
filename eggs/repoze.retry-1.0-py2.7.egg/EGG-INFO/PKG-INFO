Description: ``repoze.retry`` README
        =======================
        
        This package implements a WSGI middleware filter which intercepts
        "retryable" exceptions and retries the WSGI request a configurable
        number of times.  If the request cannot be satisfied via retries, the
        exception is reraised.
        
        Please see the documentation in ``docs/index.rst``, which can be read onlin
        at http://docs.repoze.org/retry
        
        
        1.0 (2010-08-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved documentation to Sphinx.
        
        - Micro-optimization in lookup of 'wsgi.errors' from WSGI environ.
        
        
        0.9.4 (2010-03-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bug where wsgi.input read errors were not being caught for payloads
          large enough to cause a chunked read.  Also expanded the error handling for
          this part to catch IOError in addition to socket.error, since mod_wsgi has
          been observed to raise IOError in some cases.
        
        
        0.9.3 (2009-09-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Don't write a temporary file unless the request content length is
          greater than 2MB (use a StringIO instead).
        
        - Make ZPublisher.Publish:Retry exceptions retryable (via a soft dependency).
          This makes repoze.retry work the same as the Zope 2 publisher when that
          module is installed.
        
        - 100% test coverage.
        
        - Change documentation to show proper retryable exception syntax in
          paste config.
        
        
        0.9.2 (2008-07-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Close the app_iter at appropriate points to silence lint errors.
        
        - Return a Bad Request error if we get a socket error while reading
          input.
        
        - Fix traceback output to wsgi.errors (it was going to console).
        
        - Assert that downstream app must call start_response before successfully
          returning.
        
        
        0.9.1 (2008-06-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Seek wsgi.input back to zero before retrying a request due to a
          conflict error.
        
        
        0.9 (2008-06-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed concurrency bug whereby a response from one request might be
          returned as result of a different request.
        
        - Initial PyPI release.
        
        
        0.8
        ---
        
        - Added WSGI conformance testing for the middleware.
        
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        - Made the retryable exception(s) configurable, removing the hardwired
          dependency on ZODB3.
        
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        - Relaxed requirement for ZODB 3.7.2, since we might need to use
          the package with other verions.
        
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        - Depend on PyPI release of ZODB 3.7.2.  Upgrade to this by doing
          bin/easy_install -U 'ZODB3 >= 3.7.2, < 3.8.0a' if necessary.
        
        
        0.4
        ---
        
        - Write retry attempts to 'wsgi.errors' stream if availabile.
        
        - Depend on rerolled ZODB 3.7.1 instead of zopelib.
        
        - Add license and copyright, change trove classifiers.
        
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        - We now buffer the result of a downstream application's
          'start_response' call so we can retry requests which have already
          called start_response without breaking the WSGI spec (the server's
          start_response may only be called once unless there is an exception,
          and then it needs to be called with an exc_info three-tuple,
          although we're uninterested in that case here).
        
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        - The entry point name was wrong (it referred to "tm").  Change it so
          that egg:repoze.retry#retry should work in paste configs.
        
        - Depend on zopelib rather than ZODB 3.8.0b3 distribution, because the
          ZODB distribution pulls in various packages (zope.interface and ZEO
          most notably) that are incompatible with stock Zope 2.10.4 apps and
          older sandboxes.  We'll need to revisit this.
        
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        - Initial release.
