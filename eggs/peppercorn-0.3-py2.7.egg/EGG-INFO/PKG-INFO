Description: Peppercorn
        ==========
        
        A library for converting a token stream into a data structure
        comprised of sequences, mappings, and scalars, developed primarily for
        converting HTTP form post data into a richer data structure.
        
        Please see `http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.3 (2010-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - 0.2 was a brownbag release; a case was not handled where ``rename``
          operation types may not have children.  This release fixes that.
        
        0.2 (2010-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - New operation type: ``rename``.  ``rename`` begins a special mode.
          The value of the first subsequent data element in the stream will be
          used within it's parent sequence or mapping; any remaining data
          elements until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker are ignored.
          This is mostly in support of radio buttons.  See the ``rename`` docs
          within `http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn
          <http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn>`_ for more information.
        
        0.1 (2010-03-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
